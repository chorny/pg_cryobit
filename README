pg_cryobit README
=================

pg_cryobit allows you to set up your PostgreSQL continuous backup from a centralized point.

It can manage different wal logs and backup shipping methods via plugins.


HOW TO INSTALL AND USE:
-----------------------

0 - Install from CPAN:

$ cpan -i App::PgCryobit

1 - Write a pg_cryobit.conf configuration file and put it in your current directory, $HOME, or /etc/. See CONFIGURATION section.

2 - In your postgresql.conf, set your PostgeSQL server so it uses pg_cryobit as an archive command.

It can be as simple as this:

archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'pg_cryobit archivewal --file=%p'

3 - Restart your PostgreSQL server and test your configuration:

$ pg_cryobit fullarchive

(Note: this will perform a test wal logs switch and an archive snapshot)

4 - Whenever you want to take a full snapshot of your PostgreSQL DB, use:

$ pg_cryobit archivesnapshot

5 - Job done.
